Final Project Proposal: Sound on Sound

For my final workshop, I would like to present on the subject of sound synthesis through the use of modular synthesizers.  The workshop is intended for those with little to no sound design experience or those who have experience in sound design with an interest but no experience with modular synthesis.  Modular synthesizers are often intimidating because they are seemingly unintuitive, jumbled with patch cables, and I’d like to help bridge that gap amongst those who have an interest.  An even bigger hurdle with these instruments is that they are expensive, and therefore the average musician might not have access to even try them.  

This workshop will touch upon the history of analog synthesis as well as pioneers in the field, and will flow into an explanation of common synthesis components and techniques, all culminating in a hands-on interactive session where students can design their own sounds. 

**In order to give students sufficient time to use my synthesizer in the final portion of the workshop, this class is designed for no more than 5 people.  With access to more equipment, it can easily be scaled for more participants.**  

The workshop will follow the below syllabus:

20 min - Lecture 
* Intro to sound design
* History of sound/modular synthesis
* Inventors
  * Bob Moog 
  * Don Buchla 
* Women in Synthesis 
  * Daphne Oram
  * Delia Derbyshire
* Components of a synthesizer
  * Basic synth voice 
   * VCO - Voltage Controlled Oscillator
   * Waveforms - Sine, Square, Triangle, Sawtooth, Noise
   * 1 V/OCT
   * VCF - Voltage Controlled Filter
   * VCA - Voltage Controlled Amplifier
   * LFO - Low-Frequency Oscillator 
   * ADSR Envelope - Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release 
   * Mixer 
* Analog vs Digital 
* Modern Modular Gurus
  * Richard Devine
  * Joseph Fraioli (Datach'i)
  * Bana Haffar
  * Lightbath

20 min - Demonstration 
* Building a synth voice with participation from the students 
* Patch techniques 
* Making a ‘song’ - introduction of new modules 
  * Sequencers
  * Complex oscillators 

20 min - Hands on:
* Patching 
* Knob twiddling 
* Listening
* Jamming

My goal with this workshop is to demystify modular synthesis and to bring awareness to what an exciting, and even simple, platform they provide for experimental sound exploration.
